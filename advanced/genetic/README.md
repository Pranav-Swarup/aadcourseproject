### binpacking-genetic-algorithm
An implementation of Emmanuel Falkenauer's grouping genetic algorithm to solve one-dimensional bin-packing.

The initial population is generated by starting at a random position in the item array and applying First-Fit as mentioned in the paper.

Crossover is simply BPRX using replacement to place the remaining items.

Mutation deletes random bins in every chromosome and places the items back into the chromosome using First-Fit. This is to make use of randomness to hopefully improve current chromosome(solution).



The child population completely replaces the previous population except for the single most fit chromosome from the previous population.
